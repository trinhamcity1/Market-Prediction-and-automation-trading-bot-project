# Phase 3: Model Building and Optimization
## Sub-tasks:

- Develop models: Develop a range of machine learning models such as regression, decision trees, or neural networks.
- Optimize models: Use hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize the models' performance.
- Evaluate models: Evaluate the accuracy of the models and select the best-performing one.
- Refine models: Refine the chosen model to further improve its accuracy.

## Getting started:

- Use Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Keras, or TensorFlow to develop and optimize machine learning models.
- Use GridSearchCV to perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
- Use performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate the models.
