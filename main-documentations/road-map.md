# Roadmap
## Phase 1: Data Collection and Pre-Processing
Collect historical market data from various sources, such as financial websites and APIs
Pre-process and clean the data to remove any errors or inconsistencies
Create a database to store the pre-processed data
## Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends in the data
Create new features based on the EDA findings
Prepare the data for machine learning model development
## Phase 3: Model Building and Optimization
Develop a range of machine learning models, such as regression, decision trees, and neural networks
Optimize the models using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
Evaluate the accuracy of the models and select the best-performing one
## Phase 4: Automated Trading Bot Development
Develop an automated trading bot that uses the prediction model to execute trades
Create a user interface for the bot that allows users to set their preferred risk thresholds
Implement a risk management system that prevents the bot from trading beyond the user's risk tolerance
## Phase 5: Testing and Deployment
Test the system to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction model and the effectiveness of the automated trading bot
Deploy the system in a production environment
Provide user documentation and technical support for the application
## Phase 6: User Interface Development and Mobile Application
Develop a user interface to display the predictions and trading activity
Create a web-based dashboard for easy access to the system
Develop a mobile application for users to access the system on-the-go
Test and refine the user interface for optimal user experience
## Conclusion
The above roadmap outlines the main phases and tasks required to build the Market Prediction and Automated Trading Bot Application. Each phase has several sub-tasks that will need to be completed in order to achieve the desired results. The completion of Phase 6, including the user interface development and mobile application, will improve accessibility and usability of the application for users. It's also important to ensure that the system is continuously monitored and updated to adapt to changing market conditions and to ensure that it remains accurate and effective over time.
