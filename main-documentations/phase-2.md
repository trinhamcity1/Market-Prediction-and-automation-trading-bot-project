# Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
## Sub-tasks:

- Analyze the data: Use statistical and visual methods to identify patterns and trends in the data.
- Create new features: Develop new features based on the EDA findings, such as moving averages or technical indicators.
- Select features: Choose the features that are most predictive for the machine learning model.
- Split the data: Divide the data into training and testing sets for model development.

## Getting started:

- Use Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization and analysis.
- Use Python libraries such as TA-Lib or Finta to calculate technical indicators for feature engineering.
- Use Scikit-learn to split the data into training and testing sets.
