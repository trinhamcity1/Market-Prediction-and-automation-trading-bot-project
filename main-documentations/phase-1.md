- Collect the data: Retrieve the historical market data from the chosen data sources.
- Clean the data: Remove any errors or inconsistencies in the data, such as missing values, duplicates, or outliers.
- Transform the data: Prepare the data in a way that can be used for machine learning, such as by normalizing or scaling the data.
- Store the data: Store the pre-processed data in a database for future use.

## Getting started:

- Research financial data sources and APIs, and choose ones that fit your project's needs.
- Use Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to pre-process the data.
