# Market Prediction and Automated Trading Bot Application Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system that will use historical market data to predict the future trend of various markets. It will leverage a range of algorithmic techniques, including statistical analysis, time-series forecasting, and artificial intelligence to make predictions.

Once the prediction is presented, the system will automatically give the users options to participate organized trades through an automated trading bot. The bot will use pre-defined threshold settings that allow the user to control the level of risk they are willing to take on each trade or letting the system to perform trading based on the learned prediction.
